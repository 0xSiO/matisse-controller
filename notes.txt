Requirements: NI VISA software, Python 3, pyvisa 1.9.1

The Matisse device ID is constant under visa.ResourceManager().list_resources()
Always USB0::0x17E7::0x0102::07-40-01::INSTR at least on my machine :/ Have to confirm this for other computers

PyVisa-Py doesn't work on Linux, and the proprietary VISA libraries are a nightmare to install, don't bother

Average execution time of various commands:
Grabbing DC diode power: ~0.5 ms
Grabbing BiFi motor pos: ~3.3 ms
Grabbing BiFi wavelength: ~4.4 ms
Grabbing TE motor pos: ~3.8 ms
Grabbing refcell pos (SCAN:NOW?): ~0.5 ms
Note: SCAN:DEVICE? returns 2, which is the ID of the refcell piezo. This is expected.

An error will lock all commands :(
Have to use ERROR:CLEAR to continue querying.
Error display syntax: "!ERROR N" where N is the number of errors on the stack

Trying to run/stop the control loops for slow/fast piezos multiple times in a row is fine, no errors.
When stabilizing the laser, the reference cell, slow piezo, fast piezo, and piezo etalon all change.
The reference cell limits for the scan are usually left alone, and the up/down directions specified in the commander
software indicate where the reference cell mirror is going, continuing the scan until it hits one of those limits.

SCAN:MODE? -> up = 0, down = 1. up = increase wavelength, down = decrease wavelength
We can set the scan mode while a scan is running without any issues.

Detailed process for setting wavelength:
1. Set approx. wavelength using BiFi.
2. Scan the BiFi back and forth and measure the total laser power at each point. Power looks like upside-down parabolas.
3. Find all local maxima of the laser power data. Move the BiFi to the maximum that's closest to the desired wavelength.
4. Scan the thin etalon back and forth and measure the thin etalon reflex at each point.
5. Find all local minima of the reflex data. Move the TE to the minimum that's closest to the desired wavelength. Maybe
   use a binary search?
6. Shift the TE to the left or right a little bit. We want to be on the "flank" of the chosen parabola. Distance to
   shift: about 1/5 the distance between current minimum and next local maximum.
7. Adjust the piezo etalon until desired wavelength is reached.
8. Lock slow piezo, thin etalon, piezo etalon, then fast piezo. Stabilize at the desired wavelength.

Wavemeter is read via serial port connection. Since I don't have a serial port I'll have to look at the existing MATLAB
code that's currently used to read the wavelength and hope for the best. Maybe try testing out Python -> serial commands
on the Fianium laser.

Reading from wavemeter: use VAL? command, value is the last 8 bytes of the response. Split it at the comma.
IDN?: b'*IDN$ Coherent Inc,WaveMaster,W0364,A1.1V1.6\r\n'
Error format: b'ERR$ 01\r\n'
Value format: b'VAL$ 59445457, 737.776\r\n'

Adjusting the refcell will simultaneously change positions of other piezos (notably the slow piezo and piezo etalon).
Other piezos appear to travel opposite the direction of the refcell.
For larger drifts on stabilization scan the refcell is not great, so jump over another mode using the TE piezo.

If you reach the limits of any piezo while adjusting the wavelength:
  - For SMALL corrections:
    - To increase wavelength: set slow piezo and piezo etalon to large values, set refcell to small value. This
      shouldn't change the wavelength very much. Then you can increase the refcell more.
    - If the drift is still too high after this adjustment, consider the case for larger corrections instead or ask for
      manual correction from the user
  - For LARGER corrections:
    - For larger corrections, you're going to need to adjust the TE piezo. Might be better to just repeat the whole
      wavelength-setting process here.
